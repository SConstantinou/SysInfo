# SysInfo

SysInfo module will help you get the system information that you need from local and remote machines.
SysInfo will allow you to utilize CIM cmdlets in an easier way. Instead of trying to find the class name and filter
based on the return code to get the exact data that you need, you can get what you need with SysInfo module. It
utilizes CIM cmdlets to get the information from local and remote computer but the output of the properties of
the system components has no codes. Codes have been converted into a more readable format, giving you the
actual meaning of each code. As different types of sizes are provided in bytes, which in many times this is not
helpful, additional properties will be included in the output, providing you the size also in other format that
will help you out perform your job.
